# Simple Games ðŸŽ®

This is a super fun console-based collection of games that I built using Java 17 and Gradle 7.3. The project is a bit of an adventure for me as I'm exploring how to create engaging games mainly using the standard libraries in Java. 

## What's up with Simple Games?

As someone who is still in the early stages of my programming journey, I wanted to really understand the core of Java and its standard libraries. So, I thought, why not learn by doing something fun - hence, Simple Games was born! 

The games here, like "Rock, Paper, Scissors" (Janken) and "Hit and Blow", are simple, but they've helped me understand different programming concepts.

## Project Structure

This project uses the following technologies:

- Java 17
- Gradle 7.3
- Reflections for classpath scanning
- Lombok for reducing boilerplate code

The application logic is divided into multiple services, models, enums, and utilities to maintain a clean architecture.
